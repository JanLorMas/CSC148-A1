My submission to the first assignment for CSC148: Introduction to Computer Science
## Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a sequence of events that occur within a ride-sharing service, such as ride requests, driver assignments, and ride completions. The simulation models the behavior of the service, handling events that represent different actions in the system, such as when a passenger requests a ride, when a driver is dispatched, and when a ride is completed.
